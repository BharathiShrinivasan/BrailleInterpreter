# BrailleInterpreter
Simple prototype design of a Visually Impaired aiding device, to interpret signs and alarm in emergency situation

## Description
Proposal to develop a system that would aid visually impaired personal to interpret day-to-day sign (i.e., traffic sign board, shop boards etc.,) and also alert/warn in case of situations (i.e., any obstacle ahead, sudden ambient light intensity change). Nitty-gritty, it basically reads the sign image, recognises sign via OCR, which then processed by Braille module that actuates matrix tactile to standard Braille Grade-I representation of dot-space matrix. The challenged person can touch the tactile and comprehend the sign/warning ahead. In case of emergency the tactile can be vibrated in a pattern so as to differentiate it from normal sign message.
